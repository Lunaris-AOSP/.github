## Why is the Source Private?

This is my personal project for learning more about Android and custom ROM development.

Lunaris AOSP may contain a few commits with improper authorization. To avoid unnecessary drama, the source has not been made public at this time. Apologies for any inconvenience. This is because I'm just lazy to check and fix those commits, but I respect all developers for their contributions.

## Credits

A huge thanks to the developers of all the ROMs from which Lunaris AOSP cherry-picks features, as well as the Android open-source community for making all this possible.
